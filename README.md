# Exploring Wikipedia Clickstreams with PySpark

Welcome to my project! In this notebook, I dive into Wikipedia Clickstreams. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed Wikipediaâ€™s Clickstream data using PySpark SQL. Clickstreams are the paths that users follow when they click from one Wikipedia article to another. This project was a great opportunity to apply my data analysis skills and work with a real-world dataset.

## What's Inside

- **Wikipedia_Clickstream_Analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains all the code and analysis.
- **data/**: The folder where I stored the cleaned clickstream data.
- **results/**: The folder where I saved the analysis results.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning**: I cleaned and prepared the clickstream data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: I performed various analyses to understand user behavior on Wikipedia.
- **PySpark**: I used PySpark SQL for data processing and querying.


I hope you find my project interesting and that it demonstrates my skills and enthusiasm for data analysis. Thank you for taking the time to look at my work!
